## Introduction
This project is for my 3rd year module graph theory which I am using neo4j to represent a timetabling system for a college in graph database form. The project will show timetabling system in graph form and the releationships in the graph between the different parts of the TT system.

### Prerequisits (Getting started)

1. [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/download/) - Website where to download neo4j graph database

2. [Regex editor](http://regexr.com/) - Online Regex editor 

3. [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - Text editor that can use regex and create csv files

### Aims

> The aims of the project are to show that I could reperesent a prototype for a timetabling system in the form of a graph database 

## Database

The nodes of the timetabling graph are as follows,

| Node | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Course | This node contains info on courses the college runs |
| Lecturers | This node contains info on lecturers and their contact info |
| Rooms | This node contains info on the Rooms of the college |
| Time slots | This node contains info on the times that classes will be on at |
| Student groups | This node will contain info on the student groups of an course |
| Modules | This node will contain info on the modules of a course |

### Neo4j

- talk about neo4j

### Cypher

- talk about cypher(What the hell is it and what does it do)

## Implementation 

### Data extraction

### Data Implementation

### Cypher Queries

> There are queries I used to search the nodes of the database
> Match n Return n;
