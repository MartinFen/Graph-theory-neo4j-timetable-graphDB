## Introduction
This project is for my 3rd year module graph theory which I am using neo4j to represent a timetabling system for a college in graph database form. The project will show parts of the timetable and their releationships between them.

The parts of the timetabling system are as follows,

| Parts | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Course | This node contains info on courses the college runs |
| Lecturers | This node contains info on lecturers and their contact info |
| Rooms | This node contains info on the Rooms of the college |
| Time slots | This node contains info on the times that classes will be on at |
| Student groups | This node will contain info on the student groups of an course |
| Modules | This node will contain info on the modules of a course |
